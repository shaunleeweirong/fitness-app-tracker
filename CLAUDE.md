## Body Part Visualization Feature

### Overview
Interactive body silhouettes for muscle group selection, workout customization, and progress tracking - inspired by professional fitness apps.

### Technical Implementation
**Approach:** SVG-based interactive body silhouettes using `flutter_svg` package
**Scope:** 8-12 major muscle groups per body view (front/back)
**Interaction:** Tap-to-select muscle groups with visual highlighting

### Feature Integration Across Phases
- **Phase 1C**: Visual muscle group filtering for exercise selection
- **Phase 1D**: Workout customization with body part targeting and time selection
- **Phase 1G**: Progress visualization with workout history heat mapping on body silhouettes
- **Phase 1H**: XP/level visualization per muscle group

### Body Part Mapping (Simplified)
**Front View:** Chest, Shoulders, Arms (biceps), Abs, Quads
**Back View:** Upper Back, Arms (triceps), Lower Back, Glutes, Hamstrings, Calves

### Implementation Benefits
- **Visual Exercise Discovery**: Users can tap body parts to find relevant exercises
- **Workout Customization**: Visual selection of target muscle groups
- **Progress Motivation**: See workout history and progress mapped to body parts
- **Professional UX**: Matches industry-standard fitness app interfaces

### Technical Limitations
- Simplified anatomical representation (major muscle groups only)
- Static SVG silhouettes (not 3D or animated body models)
- Focus on functionality over detailed anatomical accuracy
