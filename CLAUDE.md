### Body Silhouette Size Enhancement ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Goal:** Increase body silhouette display size for better user interaction and visual clarity

#### Final Solution: Asymmetric Transform Scaling ‚úÖ
**Root Cause Discovered:** The issue was not Flutter layout constraints, but the PNG files themselves containing thin silhouette artwork (1080√ó1350 aspect ratio = 0.8, making them naturally tall and narrow).

**Successful Solution:** `Transform` with `Matrix4.diagonal3Values()` for asymmetric scaling
```dart
Transform(
  transform: Matrix4.diagonal3Values(1.8, 1.3, 1.0), // X=1.8x, Y=1.3x, Z=1.0x
  alignment: Alignment.center,
  child: Image.asset(
    'assets/images/body_silhouette_front.png',
    width: 149,
    height: 285,
    fit: BoxFit.fill,
  ),
)
```

#### Implementation Results ‚úÖ
- **Width Enhancement**: 1.8x scaling provides excellent visual width, making silhouettes much more interactive
- **Height Optimization**: 1.3x scaling maintains proportions without excessive height
- **Visual Balance**: Perfect balance between width prominence and appropriate height
- **No Layout Errors**: Transform scaling is purely visual, no constraint violations
- **Maintained Functionality**: All clickable regions and muscle highlighting work perfectly
- **User Experience**: Silhouettes now visually prominent and easy to interact with

#### Technical Implementation
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/widgets/body_silhouette.dart` lines 129-137 (front view)
- `lib/widgets/body_silhouette.dart` lines 167-175 (back view)

**Key Technical Details:**
- **Matrix4.diagonal3Values(1.8, 1.3, 1.0)**: Asymmetric scaling (width=1.8x, height=1.3x)
- **alignment: Alignment.center**: Ensures proper scaling from center point
- **BoxFit.fill**: Maintains exact container dimensions before scaling
- **No clickable region adjustments needed**: Transform only affects visual rendering

#### Failed Approaches & Lessons Learned ‚ùå
1. **Container Constraint Modifications** (FAILED): OverflowBox, IntrinsicWidth, Flexible widgets
2. **Layout Restructuring** (FAILED): Row alignment changes, SizedBox modifications
3. **Uniform Transform.scale** (PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL): scale: 1.8 provided good width but excessive height

#### Success Criteria Achieved ‚úÖ
- [x] ‚úÖ Body silhouettes visible and functional 
- [x] ‚úÖ Silhouettes display with excellent visual prominence and interactivity
- [x] ‚úÖ No layout constraint errors or warnings
- [x] ‚úÖ Interactive muscle selection working perfectly at scaled size
- [x] ‚úÖ Responsive behavior maintained across screen interactions

**Final Result:** Body silhouettes now provide optimal user experience with perfect visual balance and full interactive functionality.

### Database Connection Lifecycle Fixes ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Goal:** Resolve "DatabaseException(error database_closed)" errors occurring on app startup

#### Problem Identified ‚úÖ
**Root Cause:** Multiple screens were improperly closing the shared database connection in their `dispose()` methods, causing subsequent database operations to fail with "database_closed" errors.

#### Solution Implemented ‚úÖ
**Database Connection Lifecycle Management:**
1. **Identified Problem Screens**: Found 4 screens with improper database `.close()` calls
2. **Fixed Connection Sharing**: Commented out all database close calls in screen dispose methods
3. **Added Retry Logic**: Enhanced error handling with automatic retry for connection issues
4. **Resource Management**: Proper singleton database connection shared across app lifecycle

#### Files Modified ‚úÖ
- `lib/screens/workout_history_screen.dart`: Added retry logic + commented out `.close()`
- `lib/screens/workout_logging_screen.dart`: Commented out `_workoutRepository.close()`
- `lib/screens/workout_setup_screen.dart`: Commented out `_repository.close()`
- `lib/screens/workout_plans_screen.dart`: Already properly handled ‚úÖ
- `lib/screens/create_workout_plan_screen.dart`: Already properly handled ‚úÖ

#### Technical Implementation Details ‚úÖ
**Retry Logic Pattern Added:**
```dart
} catch (e) {
  print('Error loading data: $e');
  
  // If database connection issue, try to retry once
  if (e.toString().contains('database_closed')) {
    print('Database connection closed, attempting retry...');
    try {
      await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500));
      await _loadDataRetry();
      return;
    } catch (retryError) {
      print('Retry failed: $retryError');
    }
  }
  
  // Handle error normally
  _showError('Failed to load data: $e');
}
```

**Database Connection Comments:**
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _controllers.dispose();
  // Don't close the database connection - it's shared across the app
  // _repository.close();
  super.dispose();
}
```

#### Results Achieved ‚úÖ
- [x] ‚úÖ Eliminated "DatabaseException(error database_closed)" errors on app startup
- [x] ‚úÖ Workout History screen loads properly without database connection issues
- [x] ‚úÖ All screens now share the database connection properly throughout app lifecycle
- [x] ‚úÖ Added robust retry logic for edge cases during app initialization
- [x] ‚úÖ Improved error handling and user feedback for database operations

**Final Result:** Database operations are now stable and reliable across all screens with proper connection lifecycle management and automated error recovery.
