# Weight Lifting Fitness Tracker - Claude Code Instructions

## Session Startup Protocol
At the start of each coding session:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** to check current project status and phase
2. **Check MCP Documentation** before implementing new features:
   - Run: `mcp__Context7__resolve-library-id flutter` for Flutter updates
   - Run: `mcp__Context7__resolve-library-id firebase` for Firebase updates
   - Search relevant documentation for the current development phase

## Development Workflow
- Follow the incremental phases defined in CLAUDE.md (1A through 1J)
- Complete each phase fully before moving to the next
- Update progress checkboxes in CLAUDE.md after completing tasks
- Test each component incrementally

## Key Reminders
- **Dark theme by default** - gym-friendly UI with high contrast
- **Large tap targets** - easy interaction during workouts
- **Firebase integration** - always check latest documentation for auth and Firestore
- **Security first** - review Firebase security rules and authentication best practices

## Pre-Implementation Checklist
Before coding any new feature:
□ Check CLAUDE.md for current phase requirements
□ Look up latest documentation via MCP tools
□ Verify package versions and compatibility
□ Review existing code patterns in the project

## Testing Standards
- Test on iOS simulator for each phase
- Manual testing preferred for workout flow components
- Ensure offline capability works properly
- Validate dark theme readability

This is a fitness tracking app with gamification - prioritize core workout functionality before advanced features.
